# Budget Assistant

## What this app does NOT do:
* This app does not track or represent the value of any of your accounts.
* This app does not act as a log of your financial transactions.
* This app does not manage money. Rather, it is a tool to help YOU manage money.

## Intended use:

### The purpose of this app is to help you...
1. track and view your income and/or expenses **generally**, *as you record/list them*.
2. *quickly* calculate how much money would be in an account on a certain date given:
    1. the start date you select,
    2. the start amount you enter, and
    3. the income and expenses expected between the start and end dates.
3. categorize your monthly expenses and view the breakdown of your expenses by category.
4. list financial or general goals and mark them as completed so you can see the progress you have made.

### Some suggestions:
If you're new to budgeting, you should consider keeping a log of every dollar that comes into your account(s) and every dollar that leaves your account(s) over a certain time period (you can start with a day, week or month). If it isn't your habit to check your income against your expenses, this might reveal money habits you didn't know you had and help you start using your money the way you *want* to use your money.

Occasionally check that the categories and items you have listed in your budget closely align with your actual expenditures and income. The more frequently your expenditures or income change, the more important it is that you check **expected** income/outgo against **actual** income/outgo. Estimating with relative accuracy the amount of money to expect in your account on a future date is what makes it possible to plan reasonably for future expenses large and small.
